## Loom

**Loom** is a modular generative music platform for Ableton Live, currently in private beta.

To receive updates or participate in the beta, please sign up at [loommakesmusic.com](http://loommakesmusic.com/).

The core framework is written in [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) and is planned to be published here once it's ready for open source scrutiny, in late 2013.

The [Max For Live](https://www.ableton.com/en/live/max-for-live/) implementation is also planned to be released in late 2013.

_**Note**: This repository previously contained the pre-alpha JRuby implmentation of Loom, which is now deprecated._
