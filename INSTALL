  MUSIC LOOM: INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS
 
  Copyright October 2010, Adam Florin. All rights reserved.


Requirements:

  Ableton Live 8+
  MaxMSP 5+
  Max For Live
  ajm.ruby
  Java


To install on Mac OS:

* Put the source dir wherever you like; you'll set up links to it in the next steps.

* Make an alias to "m4l" in:
  ~/Library/Application Support/Ableton/Library/Presets/MIDI Effects/Max MIDI Effect/
  (so that Live can pick up the player devices)

* In Max, make sure the "ruby" and "max" dirs are picked up in Options > File Preferences...
  (so that subpatchers and Ruby max external code is picked up)

* Make sure the "ruby.loadpaths" ajm.ruby setting points to the "ruby" dir (WITH trailing slash!):
  /Applications/Max5/Cycling '74/java/lib/ajm.ruby.properties
  (so that Ruby requires can pull in libraries)

* Be sure to quit & re-start MaxMSP & Live after changing any of these settings!


NOTE: Max and Ruby will both log to Console.app, so check there first to troubleshoot.
