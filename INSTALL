  MUSIC LOOM: INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS
 
  Copyright October 2010, Adam Florin. All rights reserved.


Requirements:

  Ableton Live 8+
  MaxMSP 5+
  Max for Live
  JRuby for Max
  Java


To install on Mac OS:

* Put the source dir wherever you like; you'll set up links to it in the next steps.

* Make an alias to "m4l" in:
  ~/Library/Application Support/Ableton/Library/Presets/MIDI Effects/Max MIDI Effect/
  (so that Live can pick up the player devices)

* In Max, make sure the "ruby" and "max" dirs are picked up in Options > File Preferences...
  (so that subpatchers and Ruby max external code is picked up)

Be sure to quit & re-start MaxMSP & Live after changing any of these settings!


NOTE: Max and Ruby will both log to Console.app, so check there first to troubleshoot.
