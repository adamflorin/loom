# Loom Installation

Loom has only been tested on Mac OS (10.6+).

Requirements:

* [Ableton Live 8.1+](http://www.ableton.com/live-8)
* [MaxMSP 5.1+](http://cycling74.com/products/max/)
* [Max for Live](http://www.ableton.com/maxforlive)
* [JRuby for Max](https://github.com/adamjmurray/jruby_for_max)
* Java (should be preloaded on Mac OS--?)

To install on Mac OS:

* Point a file browser in Live to the `loom/m4l` directory.
* In Max, create a search path for the `loom` directory in *Options > File Preferences...*, then quit & restart MaxMSP and Live

NOTE: On Mac OS, Max and Ruby will both log to Console.app, so check there first to troubleshoot.
